# Demonstrates a few features of webpack


A very basic webpack created library:
`webpack --config webpack.config.1.basic.add.babel.js`
Import CSS into your project:
`webpack --config webpack.config.2.styles.babel.js`
Split common chunks of code into a common bundle:
`webpack --config webpack.config.3.code.splitting.babel.js`

```
